# Text-mining William Shakespeare
### "By all the vows that ever men have broke / (In number more than ever women spoke)" 

This was a final project for an English class I took winter quarter 2018. Through the course, our professor encouraged us to explore the digital humanities. When he gave us the option to submit a text-mining project instead of a final paper, I decided to try my hand at text analysis, which I was fairly new to at the time. The files attached are the product of that attempt, and it was quite a learning experience. Check the .rmd out for my code!
